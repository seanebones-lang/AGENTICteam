## üîß What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Create Your Account on Frontend

Since the webhook auto-credit isn't implemented yet, you need to manually set up your account:

**Option A: Sign Up (Recommended)**
```
1. Go to: https://www.bizbot.store/signup
2. Use the SAME email you used for Stripe payment
3. Choose any package (doesn't matter, we'll override)
4. Complete signup
5. You'll be redirected to /console
```

**Option B: Login (If you already signed up)**
```
1. Go to: https://www.bizbot.store/login
2. Enter your email
3. Enter any password (localStorage auth for now)
4. Click "Sign in"
```

### Step 2: Add Your Pro Credits

After signing up/logging in:

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Add your Pro plan credits:
window.addCredits(1500)

// Verify credits were added:
console.log(localStorage.getItem('user_credits'))
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "total": 1510,
  "used": 0,
  "remaining": 1510
}
```

### Step 3: Update Your Tier (Optional)

```javascript
// In browser console:
const profile = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user_profile'))
profile.tier = 'professional'
localStorage.setItem('user_profile', JSON.stringify(profile))
```

### Step 4: Start Using Agents!

```
1. Go to: https://www.bizbot.store/console
2. Select any agent
3. Enter your query
4. Click "Execute Agent"
5. Credits will deduct automatically (3-6 credits per execution)
```
