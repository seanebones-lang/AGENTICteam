## Testing After Deployment

Wait 2-3 minutes for Render to deploy, then test:

```bash
# Test from a NEW IP to get 3 free queries
curl -X POST https://bizbot-api.onrender.com/api/v1/packages/security-scanner/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "package_id": "security-scanner",
    "task": "Scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities in a Node.js API"
  }'
```

**Expected**: Real Claude AI response about security scanning  
**Not Expected**: "API key required" error

3. After 3 queries ‚Üí Paywall activates
4. User signs up ‚Üí Full access with credits/subscription

### Monetization
