## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Problem - Cannot Access Paid Account
**Problem**: User paid but couldn't log in  
**Root Cause**: Payment doesn't auto-create account  
**Solution**: 
- Added helpful message on login page explaining users need to sign up first
- Improved error messages to guide users
- Added support email prominently

**What the user sees now**:
```
"Just completed payment? You'll need to sign up first to create 
your account, then your credits will be added."
```

### 2. Password Reset 404 Error
**Problem**: Reset link went to non-existent page  
**Solution**: 
- Created `/reset-password` page
- Updated login page link from `/forgot-password` to `/reset-password`
- Added email support fallback for users who need immediate help

**New page includes**:
- Email input form
- Clear instructions
- Support contact info
- Redirect to login after submission

### 3. Phone Support in Chatbot
**Problem**: Chatbot mentioned phone support that doesn't exist  
**Solution**: 
- Removed "24/7 phone support" from knowledge base
- Changed to "Priority email support (response within 15 minutes)"
- Updated all references in `support_knowledge.py`

```
