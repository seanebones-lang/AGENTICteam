# URGENT: Backend Issue Detected

**Time**: 13:30 UTC  
**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL - Backend Not Responding**

---

## Issue

The backend deployed successfully but agent execution requests are **timing out after 30 seconds**.

### Symptoms
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint works: `https://bizbot-api.onrender.com/health`
- ‚ùå Agent execution endpoints timeout
- ‚ùå No response returned within 30 seconds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Backend shows "uptime: 59s" (fresh deployment)

### Test Results
```bash
curl -X POST "https://bizbot-api.onrender.com/api/v1/packages/ticket-resolver/execute"
# Result: Timeout after 30 seconds
```

---

## Possible Causes

### 1. Database Migration Issue
The WAL mode changes might require database recreation:
```python
conn.execute('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL')
```

### 2. Connection Timeout Too High
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path, timeout=30.0)
```
This might be causing requests to hang.

### 3. Missing Dependencies
The `uuid` import might not be available in production.

### 4. Database File Corruption
The old database might be incompatible with WAL mode.

---

## Immediate Actions Needed

### Option 1: Rollback Database Changes (FASTEST)
```bash
cd /Users/seanmcdonnell/Desktop/AgenticDemo/agenticteamdemo
git revert HEAD~2
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Fix Database Issues
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Look for "database" or "WAL" errors
3. May need to delete old database file

### Option 3: Simplify Connection Settings
Remove aggressive timeouts, keep only WAL mode:
```python
def _get_connection(self) -> sqlite3.Connection:
    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path, timeout=5.0)
    conn.execute('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL')
    return conn
```

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Check Render Logs
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on **bizbot-api** service
3. Click **Logs** tab
4. Look for errors after 13:24 UTC
5. Search for: "database", "WAL", "timeout", "error"

### Step 2: Share Logs
Copy any error messages you see and we can diagnose.

### Step 3: Decision Point

**If logs show database errors:**
- Delete the database file in Render
- Redeploy to recreate fresh

**If logs show timeout errors:**
- Reduce timeout from 30s to 5s
- Remove `busy_timeout` pragma

**If no clear errors:**
- Rollback to previous working version
- Test agents work again
- Apply fixes more carefully

## Rollback Command (If Needed)

```bash
cd /Users/seanmcdonnell/Desktop/AgenticDemo/agenticteamdemo

# Revert last 2 commits
git revert --no-commit HEAD~2..HEAD
git commit -m "Rollback database changes - causing timeouts"
git push origin main

# Wait 3 minutes for redeploy
sleep 180

# Test
curl -X POST "https://bizbot-api.onrender.com/api/v1/packages/ticket-resolver/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo-key-12345" \
  -d '{"package_id": "ticket-resolver", "task": "Test", "engine_type": "crewai"}' \
  --max-time 30
```

## Alternative: Quick Fix

If the issue is just the timeout being too high, we can quickly fix it:

```python
# Change from:
conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path, timeout=30.0, check_same_thread=False)
conn.execute('PRAGMA busy_timeout=30000')  # 30 seconds

# To:
conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path, timeout=5.0, check_same_thread=False)
conn.execute('PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000')  # 5 seconds
```

## Timeline Impact

### Before This Issue
- ‚úÖ Frontend working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Backend had database locking under load
- üéØ Goal: Fix concurrency

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Frontend still working
- ‚ùå Backend not responding to agent requests
- üî¥ **WORSE than before**

### Recommendation
**ROLLBACK NOW**, test works, then apply a simpler fix.

## Next Steps

1. **YOU**: Check Render logs and share any errors
2. **ME**: Diagnose based on logs
3. **DECISION**: Rollback vs Fix vs Delete Database
4. **ACTION**: Apply chosen solution
5. **TEST**: Verify agents work
6. **LAUNCH**: Only when stable
