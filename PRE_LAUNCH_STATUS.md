# Pre-Launch Status Report
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Time**: 13:25 UTC  
**Status**: 🔧 FIXING CRITICAL ISSUE

---

## Current Situation

### ❌ Critical Issue Detected
**Problem**: Database locking under concurrent load  
**Impact**: Multiple agent executions fail when users hit the system simultaneously  
**Severity**: **BLOCKER** - Must fix before launch

### Error Logs
```
database is locked
UNIQUE constraint failed: credit_transactions.id
Failed to record execution
```

---

## Fix Applied (Awaiting Deployment)

### Code Changes (Commits 69ec107 & 00284f0)
1. ✅ **WAL Mode**: Enabled Write-Ahead Logging for SQLite
2. ✅ **Connection Pooling**: Added proper connection management with 30s timeout
3. ✅ **UUID Transaction IDs**: Replaced timestamp-based IDs to prevent collisions
4. ✅ **Busy Timeout**: 30-second timeout for locked database operations

### Files Modified
- `backend/credit_system.py` - Core database fixes
- All database connections now use `_get_connection()` helper

---

## Deployment Status

### Backend (Render)

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Verification (5 tests)
```bash
./quick_test.sh
```
**Expected**: All 5 agents pass concurrently

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing (50 tests)
```bash
./COMPREHENSIVE_AGENT_TEST.sh
```
**Expected**: 40+ tests pass (80%+ success rate)

### Phase 3: Frontend Testing
Use `FRONTEND_AGENT_TEST_PLAN.md` to manually test:
- All 10 agents via console
- Credit deduction
- Result formatting
- Multi-tab functionality

---

## What Needs Fixing ❌

### Critical (Blocking Launch)
1. ❌ **Database concurrency** - IN PROGRESS (deploying fix)
2. ⚠️  **Agent testing** - Blocked by #1
3. ⚠️  **Stripe payments** - Not tested yet

### Important (Can Launch Without)
4. ⏳ **Support chatbot integration** - Claude not hooked up yet
5. ⏳ **Email verification** - Not implemented
6. ⏳ **Webhook credit crediting** - TODO in code

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk 🔴
- **Database locking** - Fix deployed, awaiting verification
- **Untested agents** - Need to verify all 10 work correctly

### Medium Risk 🟡
- **Stripe integration** - Keys configured but not tested
- **High traffic** - Unknown performance under 100+ concurrent users

### Low Risk 🟢
- **Frontend stability** - Well tested, no known issues
- **Authentication** - Working with localStorage fallback
- **UI/UX** - Professional, responsive, dark mode ready

---

## Recommendation

### 🚦 Launch Decision

**Current Status**: 🔴 **DO NOT LAUNCH YET**

**Reason**: Critical database concurrency issue

**Next Steps**:
1. ⏳ Wait for redeploy (2 min)
2. ✅ Verify fix works
3. 🧪 Test all agents
4. 📊 Review results
5. 🚀 Launch if 80%+ pass rate

**Estimated Time to Launch Ready**: 30-60 minutes
