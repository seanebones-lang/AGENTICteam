# üö® CRITICAL BUG FIXED - STRIPE CREDITS NOT ADDED

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Issue**: You paid $20 but credits were NOT added to your account  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED + Manual credit addition ready

---

## üêõ THE BUG

### What Happened:
Line 1104 in `main.py` had:
```python
# TODO: Credit user account with credits based on package purchased
# For now, just log the successful payment
```

**Result**: Stripe received your $20 payment, but the webhook only logged it - it never added credits to your account!

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

### 1. Stripe Webhook Now Adds Credits
```python
if event_type == 'checkout.session.completed':
    # Get payment details
    customer_email = session.get('customer_email')
    amount_total = session.get('amount_total', 0) / 100
    
    # Find user by email
    user = db.get_user_by_email(customer_email)
    
    # Add credits to their account
    credit_system.add_credits(
        user_id=user["id"],
        amount=amount_total,  # $20 paid = $20 credits
        transaction_type=TransactionType.PURCHASE,
        description=f"Credit purchase via Stripe - ${amount_total}"
    )
```

### 2. Admin Endpoint for Manual Credits
Created `/api/v1/admin/add-credits` endpoint so you can manually credit your account for the $20 you already paid.

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `bizbot-api` service

**Command**:
```bash

  -d '{
    "email": "YOUR_EMAIL_HERE",
    "amount": 20.0
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Files Modified:
- `backend/main.py` (lines 1104-1124, 1152-1181)

### Changes:
1. **Webhook Credit Addition** (lines 1104-1124)
   - Extracts customer_email from Stripe session
   - Looks up user in database
   - Calls `credit_system.add_credits()` with payment amount
   - Logs success/failure

2. **Admin Manual Credit Endpoint** (lines 1152-1181)
   - POST `/api/v1/admin/add-credits`
   - Requires `admin_key` header
   - Accepts `email` and `amount`
   - Adds credits and returns new balance

### Security:
- Admin endpoint requires API key (set via `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var)
- Default key is `admin-secret-key-change-me`
- **IMPORTANT**: Change this in production!

## üí∞ CREDIT CALCULATION

**Current System**: 1:1 ratio
- Pay $20 ‚Üí Get $20 credits
- Pay $100 ‚Üí Get $100 credits

**Agent Costs**:
- Ticket Resolver: $0.12 per execution
- Security Scanner: $0.15 per execution
- Knowledge Base: $0.08 per execution
- Others: $0.08-$0.20 per execution

**Your $20 gets you**:
- ~166 Ticket Resolver executions
- ~133 Security Scanner executions
- ~250 Knowledge Base queries
