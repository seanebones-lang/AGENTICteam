## 🔗 **PHASE 1: DeFi-NATIVE & ON-CHAIN TOOLS** (Weeks 1-2)

### **1.1 On-Chain Agent Actions**
Transform agents from information processors to **financial executors**

```python
# DeFi Agent Integration
class DeFiAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            agent_id="defi-executor",
            model="claude-4.5-sonnet",  # Complex financial analysis
            integrations=["walletconnect", "ethers", "uniswap", "aave"]
        )
    
    async def execute_defi_task(self, task):
        if task.type == "yield_farming":
            return await self.find_optimal_yields(task.amount, task.risk_level)
        elif task.type == "cross_chain_swap":
            return await self.execute_bridge_swap(task.from_chain, task.to_chain)
        elif task.type == "risk_assessment":
            return await self.analyze_protocol_risks(task.protocol)
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **WalletConnect v2** integration for secure wallet connections
- **Ethers.js** for blockchain interactions
- **Multi-chain support**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Solana
- **Premium tiers** unlock advanced chains and higher transaction limits

**Competitive Advantage**: No competitor offers native DeFi execution

### **1.2 Staking & Rewards System**
Create economic incentives that competitors lack

```python
# Staking System Architecture
class StakingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.staking_pools = {
            "performance_boost": {"apy": 12, "min_stake": 100},
            "governance_voting": {"apy": 8, "min_stake": 500},
            "revenue_sharing": {"apy": 15, "min_stake": 1000}
        }
    
    async def stake_credits(self, user_id, amount, pool_type):
        # Boost agent performance based on stake
        boost_multiplier = self.calculate_boost(amount)
        await self.apply_performance_boost(user_id, boost_multiplier)
        
        # Revenue sharing (20% of platform fees)
        if pool_type == "revenue_sharing":
            await self.add_to_revenue_pool(user_id, amount)
```

**Revenue Model Innovation**:
