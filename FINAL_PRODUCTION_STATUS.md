## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Current Setup (Good for Launch)
- **Database**: SQLite (works fine for 100-1000 users)
- **Vector DB**: In-memory Qdrant (resets on deploy, but works)
- **Workers**: Single worker (can handle ~100 concurrent requests)
- **Free Trial**: IP-based (sophisticated fingerprinting)

### Future Upgrades (When Scaling)
- Upgrade to PostgreSQL for 10,000+ users
- Add persistent Qdrant instance for knowledge base
- Add Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Scale to multiple workers on Render Pro

---

## BUSINESS METRICS

### Pricing (Per Execution)
- Solo: $0.005
- Basic: $0.0095
- Silver: $0.038
- Standard: $0.0475
- Premium: $0.076
- Elite: $0.2375
- BYOK: $0.002 + user's Anthropic costs

### Free Trial Economics
- **3 free queries** = ~$0.05 cost to you
- **Conversion rate target**: 10% (industry standard)
- **Acceptable CAC**: $0.50 per trial user

---

## NEXT STEPS

### 1. Wait for Deployment (2-3 min)
Monitor Render dashboard for "Live" status

### 2. Run Full System Test
```bash
./test_full_system.sh
```

### 3. Test Frontend
- Go to https://bizbot.store
- Test agent execution (should work without login)
- Test all 10 agents
- Verify paywall after 3 queries

### 4. Test User Flow
- Sign up → Login → Execute agent → Check credits
- Purchase credits → Execute more agents
- Test Stripe checkout (if configured)

### 5. Monitor Logs
Watch for any errors in Render logs
