# URGENT: Manual Render Redeploy Required

## Issue
Database locking errors are occurring under concurrent load. The fix has been pushed to GitHub but Render needs to redeploy.

## Error Logs
```
2025-10-22 13:23:19 - security_service - ERROR - Rate limit check failed: database is locked
2025-10-22 13:23:20 - credit_system - ERROR - Failed to record execution: UNIQUE constraint failed: credit_transactions.id
2025-10-22 13:23:25 - credit_system - ERROR - Failed to record execution: database is locked
```

## Fix Applied (Commit 69ec107)
1. **WAL Mode**: Enabled Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrency
2. **Connection Pooling**: Added `_get_connection()` method with 30s timeout
3. **UUID Transaction IDs**: Replaced timestamp-based IDs with UUIDs to prevent collisions
4. **Busy Timeout**: Added 30-second busy timeout for locked database

## Manual Redeploy Steps

### Option 1: Render Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your backend service: **bizbot-api**
3. Click on the service
4. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
5. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
7. Verify at: https://bizbot-api.onrender.com/health

### Option 2: Trigger via Git
```bash
# Force a rebuild by making a trivial change
cd /Users/seanmcdonnell/Desktop/AgenticDemo/agenticteamdemo
echo "# Trigger redeploy" >> backend/README.md
git add backend/README.md
git commit -m "Trigger Render redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Render CLI (if installed)
```bash
render deploy --service bizbot-api
```

## Verification After Redeploy

### 1. Check Health
```bash
curl https://bizbot-api.onrender.com/health
```

### 2. Test Concurrent Requests
```bash
cd /Users/seanmcdonnell/Desktop/AgenticDemo/agenticteamdemo
./quick_test.sh
```

### 3. Check Logs for Errors
Look for these in Render logs:
- ✅ No "database is locked" errors
- ✅ No "UNIQUE constraint failed" errors
- ✅ All agents execute successfully

## Expected Results After Fix
- ✅ 5 concurrent requests all pass
- ✅ No database locking errors
- ✅ Transaction IDs are unique
- ✅ Credit system works under load

## Timeline
- **Code pushed**: 13:17 UTC
- **Current issue**: Old code still running
- **Action needed**: Manual redeploy NOW

## Critical for Launch
This MUST be fixed before your announcement. The system will fail under load without these database fixes.

**Next Steps:**
1. Redeploy backend via Render dashboard
2. Wait 3 minutes
3. Run `./quick_test.sh` to verify
4. Proceed with full agent testing once verified
