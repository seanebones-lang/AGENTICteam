**Issue**: Signup was asking for payment  
**Status**: FIXED  
**Deployed**: Yes (Vercel will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes)

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Before (BROKEN)
- ❌ Signup asked for credit package selection
- ❌ Showed pricing ($20, $50, $100, $250)
- ❌ Confused users who already paid
- ❌ Made it seem like payment was required

### After (FIXED)
- ✅ **FREE signup** - no payment required
- ✅ Simple form: Name, Email, Password
- ✅ Clear message: "Sign up free • Get 10 credits to start • No credit card required"
- ✅ Button says "Start Free Trial"
- ✅ Automatically gives 10 free credits
- ✅ Redirects to /console to start using agents

## 🔐 Password Reset Status

### Current Status
- ✅ Password reset page created (`/reset-password`)
- ✅ Link updated in login page
- ✅ No more 404 error
- ⚠️  Email sending not implemented yet (shows success message but doesn't send)

### What Users See
1. Click "Forgot password?" on login page
2. Enter email address
3. See success message
4. Directed to contact support@bizbot.store if needed

### Future Enhancement
- Implement actual email sending via SendGrid/AWS SES
- For now, users can contact support@bizbot.store

## 🚀 How Signup Works Now

### User Flow
```
1. Go to /signup
2. Enter:
   - Organization name
   - Email
   - Password
   - Confirm password
3. Click "Start Free Trial"
4. Account created with 10 free credits
5. Redirected to /console
6. Start using agents immediately!
```

### No Payment Required
- ✅ Signup is completely free
- ✅ 10 credits given automatically
- ✅ No credit card needed
- ✅ Users can test agents before buying

### When to Buy Credits
- After using 10 free credits
- Go to /pricing page
- Choose credit package
- Pay via Stripe
- Credits added (currently manual via console)

## 💳 For Users Who Already Paid

### If You Paid But Can't Login
1. Go to /signup (not /login)
2. Use the SAME email you paid with
3. Create account (free, no payment again)
4. After signup, add your credits manually:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12)
   window.addCredits(1500)  // For Pro plan
   ```

### Why This Happens
- Stripe payment doesn't auto-create account yet
- Webhook auto-credit not implemented
- Manual workaround needed for now
- Will be automated post-launch
