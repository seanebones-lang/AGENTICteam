## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### **1. Stripe Configuration**

  - Action: Confirm LIVE keys (pk_live_..., sk_live_...) are in Render Secret File
  
- [ ] **TEST:** Stripe checkout flow end-to-end
  - Test credit purchase ($20 minimum)
  - Test subscription signup ($49/month)
  - Verify webhook receives payment confirmation
  - Confirm credits are added to user account

### **2. Email Configuration**
- [ ] **SETUP:** Configure email service for verification
  - Current: Email service code exists but not configured
  - Need: SMTP credentials (Gmail, SendGrid, or AWS SES)
  - Add to Render: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`

- [ ] **CREATE:** Email inboxes
  - support@bizbot.store (primary support)
